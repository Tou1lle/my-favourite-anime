                    Now finally to the story! <br>
                    As I mentioned above, since I watch
                    anime more then read manga, I will only cover anime and not the manga story!
                    I will also try to give as much spoiler free review as possible so I don't spoil it to much.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The story follows the main character Isagi Yoichi. The story starts, when he played
                    for a High School team and was mere moments away from scoring a goal that would send his team 
                    to the nationals. But a split-second decision to pass the ball to his teammate cost him that reality
                    Bitter, confused, and disappointed, Isagi wonders if the outcome would have been different had he not 
                    made the pass. When the young striker returns home, an invitation from the Japan Football Union awaits him. 
                    Through an arbitrary and biased decision-making process, Isagi is one of three hundred U-18 strikers selected 
                    for a controversial project named Blue Lock.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project's ultimate goal is to turn one of the selected players into the star striker for the Japanese national team. 
                    To find the best participant, each diamond in the rough must compete against others through a series of solo and team 
                    competitions to rise to the top. Putting aside his ethical objections to the project, Isagi feels compelled 
                    to fight his way to the top, even if it means ruthlessly crushing the dreams of 299 aspiring young strikers.
                </p>
                <footer class="source">(Source: My Anime List)</footer>
                <p>
                    The main quality, that all strikers need to have is <strong>ego</strong>! They need to be egoistical, they need
                    to be hungry for goals, they need to be selfish. There is also this very abstract anime
                    side, where each player has an unique ability, which are displayed exaggerated, but also very well
                    and it makes the anime more fun and exciting. That's what makes this anime different from other
                    sports anime!

                <h3 id="powersystem">Power System</h3>
                <p>
                    Blue Lock's power system is derived from real world football. For example, Messi has unique
                    ball control, Cristiano Ronaldo has a powerfull kick etc. <br>
                    In Blue Lock, every player has a special ability, every player is extraordinary it their own way.
                    Blue Lock does a really great job at showing the weapons exaggeratedly and at the same time you feel
                    like you could do it in real life too.

                                Meguru Bachira is a whimsical forward who plays following his instincts. 
                                When first arriving at Blue Lock, he was a member of Team Z during First Selection. 
                                His main goal was to find soccer rivals to play with who also have a "monster" inside of them. 
                                Later, his goal changes to becoming the best striker in the world when he overcomes his childhood trauma.

                                Chigiri Hyouma is one of the main supporting characters in the Blue Lock series. 
                                He first seemed very cautious of his knee when playing football but it was revealed 
                                that it was from a previous knee injury that had haunted him. He joined the Blue Lock Project 
                                to let go of his fear, play freely, and become Japan's #1 striker.

                    Blue Lock is a really special anime for me. It's also my first sports anime I've ever watched.
                    It's not your typical sports anime. There is no friendship, like in other animes. There is ego,
                    selfishness, and they all want to become number 1. It's the kind of anime that really gives the 
                    <strong>hype</strong>. You will feel fired up and have the feeling that you can do anything! That's
                    why I really am fond of this anime.
