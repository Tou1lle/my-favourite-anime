                Welcome to Attack on Titan. As of 2023, this is the only anime of 4 for anime on this list 
                that has officialy <strong>ended</strong>. And I can say this with absolute certainty - this story is one of the best,
                most original and with the most <strong>plot twists</strong> I have ever seen! This story just gets more
                and more dark each season. You will question yourself on what is wrong and right, and you'll realise that 
                there is no such thing as right and wrong.

                <p>
                    The anime adaptation was kind of a <em>roller coaster</em> for the fans. It was made by 2 studios as
                    time went by. The first 3 season were made by <strong>WiT Studio</strong> and the last season was made by <strong>MAPPA</strong>, which was then separated
                    into 2 parts plus 2 special editions. If that was not enough, fans had to wait a pretty long time
                    between certain seasons. This is the only deal breaker for me, but that doesn't change the fact that 
                    both studios made an absolutely perfect job animating it.

                <div class="wit-studio">
                    <p>
                        The first season aired in 2013. Then fans had to wait 4 years for 
                        season 2 to come out. Season 3 aired right year after season 2.

                        There was a 2 year gap between season 3 and the last season. MAPPA's animation
                        style was different from the Wit's, but many fans agree, that both animation styles
                        fit the seasons they were made for.

                <p>Let me say this right of the bat - AoT's story became one of the most <strong>complex</strong> ones 
                    I've seen. To simplify it - it's a story about humans vs Titans.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Centuries ago, mankind was slaughtered to near extinction by monstrous humanoid creatures called Titans, 
                    forcing humans to hide in fear behind enormous concentric walls. What makes these giants truly terrifying 
                    is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. 
                    To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter. 
                    However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal Titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, 
                    reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures, 
                    Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, 
                    an elite military unit that combats the merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls. 
                    Eren, his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman, and his childhood friend Armin Arlert join the brutal
                    war against the Titans and race to discover a way of defeating them before the last walls are breached.

                <p>
                    At the beginning, it really is just about humanity vs Titans, but as the story goes by, there are more and more mysteries with less answers!

                    <p>
                        In Attack on Titan, there are quite a few power systems. There are 2 main ones. Here in this 
                        article I'll just talk about one, the second one would reveal too much of the plot so I will 
                        leave it be
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the main power systems in AoT is the ODM gear. It's a system which humanity used to fight titans.
                        Thanks to the gear, they were able to "fly" around buildings. They were kind of like spidermen.
                        The ODM gear wasn't of course enough, they also had special swords, which were used to kill those titans.

                                Eren is Shingeki no Kyojin's protagonist. His childhood friend, Mikasa, notes on numerous 
                                occasions that he acts on impulse without thinking things through, 
                                and she often pulls/carries/throws him when he starts fighting with others to protect him from himself. 
                                Along with Mikasa, he tends to spend his free time with their mutual friend, Armin.

                                Levi is known as humanity's most powerful soldier. He's ranked as Captain of the Scouting Legion division. 
                                Levi is also the leader of the Special Operations Squad, an elite team that he hand-picked in order to protect 
                                Eren Yeager. While it is said that he is blunt and unapproachable, it is noted that he has a strong respect for 
                                structure and discipline. There are rumors that he was originally part of underground crime before he became a soldier. 
                                Although he often appears to be unfriendly, he cares deeply for his team and has never undervalued human life. 
                                He is also a notorious clean-freak.
