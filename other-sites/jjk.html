                    It's sad, that there are still some people, who complain about MAPPA's animation. We just need 
                    to appreciate the work they have done and continue doing!

                <p>
                    Idly indulging in baseless paranormal activities with the Occult Club, high schooler Yuuji Itadori spends his days at either 
                    the clubroom or the hospital, where he visits his bedridden grandfather. However, this leisurely lifestyle soon takes 
                    a turn for the strange when he unknowingly encounters a cursed item. Triggering a chain of supernatural occurrences, 
                    Yuuji finds himself suddenly thrust into the world of Curses—dreadful beings formed from human malice and negativity—after 
                    swallowing the said item, revealed to be a finger belonging to the demon Sukuna Ryoumen, the King of Curses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yuuji experiences first-hand the threat these Curses pose to society as he discovers his own newfound powers. 
                    Introduced to the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School, he begins to walk down a path from which he cannot 
                    return—the path of a Jujutsu sorcerer.

                    In some ways, Jujutsu Kaisen is really similar to <strong>Naruto</strong>, the anime 
                    known as one of the Big 3. It has 3 main characters:
                    <br> - The "stupid" but at the same time clever Main Character
                    <br> - The moody, strong and smart friend 
                    <br> - The awesome girl
                    <br> - And of course, the white haired Teacher
                    <br> You could say that JJK is the "-better Naruto".

                    <h3 id="powersystem">Power System</h3>
                    <p>
                        JJK's power system is based on <strong>Cursed Energy</strong>. There are sorcerers, who fight
                        <strong>Cursed spirits</strong> using <strong>Cursed Techniques</strong>. What are cursed spirits? They are the manifestation of our 
                        negative thoughts, you could say. They are created at places like schools, cemetery, where the
                        negative thoughts are unavoidable.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's talk a little about cursed techniques, which can be a little confusing at first.
                        As I mentioned. In JJK, sorcerers have something called Cursed Energy. This energy is 
                        nothing more that just some aura they have. For example in real life, when you throw a ball,
                        you use force, that's cursed energy. But when you want to throw the ball with some spin, you apply
                        techniques - that's Cursed Technique.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are a lot of Cursed Techniques in JJK. Some shoot fire, some manipulate space, and some 
                        can summon different beasts.

                                Yuuji, a first-year student at Tokyo Metropolitan Curse Technical College, 
                                is a muscular teenager with big light brown eyes and light brown spiky hair. 
                                After becoming a host for Sukuna, a small line appeared below each of his eyes.

                                Yuuji is a fair person who cares greatly for not only his comrades, but anyone 
                                he views as people with their own wills, despite how deep or shallow his connection to them is. 
                                He cares greatly for the "value of a life" and to this end he will ensure that others receive a 
                                "fair death." He is easy to anger in the face of pure cruelty and unfair judgement of other people.
