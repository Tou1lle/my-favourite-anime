                        JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is a Japanese manga written and illustrated by <strong>Hirohiko Araki</strong>.
                        It was originally serialized in Shueisha's shonen manga magazine <strong>Weekly Shonen Jump</strong>
                        from 1987 to 2004. It was then transferred to the monthly seinen manga magazine <strong>Ultra Jump</strong>
                        in 2005. So far JoJo is divided into 9 story arc, each following a <strong>new protagonist</strong>
                        (that's what makes this anime so unique) bearing the nickname <strong>JoJo</strong>. As of August
                        2023, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure has collected an incredible amount of 132 volumes.

                        <strong>Hirohiko Araki</strong>. Araki was born in 1960 and is, as you could
                        guess it, a manga artist. He is best known for his long-running series <strong>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</strong>.
                        JoJo's began its publication since 1987 and has sold over 120 million copies,
                        making it one of the best-selling manga series in history.

                        His first work was before graduating, a one-shot Poker Under Arms. Right After this,
                        he debuted with his most famous work JoJo's. He then made a lot of spin-offs based
                        on the JoJo series. The most famous one is about <strong>Rohan Kishibe</strong>, one of the characters
                        in the series.

                <p>
                    If I could summarize JoJo's Bizarre Adventure's story, I would say "original". There is no other anime
                    like JoJo's. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    What is so original about JoJo's you may ask, well - there are multiple main characters. In each part,
                    there is a new protagonist. That doesn't mean that the parts aren't connected - they are. At first,
                    I was worried, you get fond of a character and then you realize that the new part will have a new 
                    protagonist. But trust me - that's what makes JoJo so special.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each part has its own storyline. But it all starts of in late 19th century, when Jonathan Joestar, a young son of a wealthy 
                    landowner, meets his new adopted brother Dio Brando. This single moment led to some of the most 
                    amazing storylines and beatiful emotional moments.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h3 id="powersystem">Power System</h3>
                <p>
                    JoJo's has one of the most original powersystems in all of anime, it is also one of the best 
                    and most fun I've ever seen. In the first 2 Parts, they use something called <strong>Hamon</strong>.
                    But in later parts, they fight using something called <strong>STANDS</strong>. Stand is a physical
                    manifestation of a person's <em>life energy</em>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A Stand is an entity psychically generated by its owner, referred to as a <strong>STAND USER</strong>.
                    The abilities and its strength all depend on the owner of the Stand. Normally, Stands aren't visible to 
                    non-Stand users. Here is the list of some Stands I chose to show you.

                            and speed. It also gained the ability to stop time.

                                Joutarou is Holy Kuujou's son and Joseph Joestar's grandson. 
                                When Joutarou first appears, he turned himself in to the police because 
                                he believes his Stand is an evil spirit possessing him. 
                                To demonstrate, he steals a gun from a prison guard, and tries to shoot 
                                himself in the head—a phantom hand emerges from his arm and catches the bullet, 
                                however, only Holy sees the hand. This act naturally earned the widespread fear 
                                of the guards and other prisoners towards him.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Joutarou is both fierce and gentle, and he shows these traits in various scenes, 
                                from the fight with N'Dour to the encounter with D'Arby. One shining example is 
                                how he spared Noriaki Kakyouin, instead of destroying him outright, knowing that 
                                Kakyouin attacked him unwillingly and was under Dio's influence. 
                                The same happened for Polnareff, whom he saved as well. 
                                Both became invaluable allies to the end. Unlike with both D'Arby brothers, 
                                who got the full brunt of Joutarou's ferocity, he saw in N'Dour blind loyalty 
                                rather than greed and evil that was evident with the other enemies. 
                                Though still loyal to Dio, N'Dour respected Joutarou for his strength, 
                                despite being an enemy, until he breathed his last. In return, Joutarou gave 
                                N'Dour a decent burial in the desert.

                                Jousuke makes his entrance into the JoJo universe as a caring, popular, and slightly naïve teenager. 
                                Inspired by his police officer grandfather's (on his mother's side) sense of justice, 
                                he isn't afraid to fight for those in need. He is confronted by Joutarou with the need to 
                                eradicate evil Stand users from his hometown, Morioh. He refuses at first, 
                                believing that it is not any of his business. However, 
                                he quickly changes his mind when his policeman grandfather is killed by a criminal Stand user. 
                                With a vow paralleling that of Peter Parker, 
                                Jousuke decides to deliver justice to evil Stand users in his grandfather's place.

                                everything in her power to help her friends. Jolyne believed that her loved ones had a good heart 
                                and an honest nature. Unfortunately, she can believe in them to the point of being gullible as it
